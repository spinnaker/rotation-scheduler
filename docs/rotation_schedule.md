## rotation schedule

Schedule creation and extension functions.

### Synopsis

These options control the shift output, like providing the user list (or how to get a user list) and how long to make each shift. For GitHub team integration, users can be invited to their shift by making their email public.

### Options

```
      --domains strings         Only include email addresses from --github that match these domains. A single value of '*' will allow any domain. Use '--domains []' to only use GitHub usernames. (default [*])
  -g, --github strings          Fetch the user list from GitHub. Order of args must be 'organization,team,accessToken'. Must specify an access token with read:org permissions.
  -h, --help                    help for schedule
  -d, --shiftDurationDays int   Optional. Duration in days for each shift. Defaults to 7, must be a positive integer. (default 7)
      --stop string             Required. Generate schedule stopping on this date (inclusive). Must be in the format 2006-01-02
  -u, --users strings           Set of users for the rotation. Required if --github* options are not specified.
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

  -r, --record string   Record the responses from external dependencies to the specified file. Used for external dependency testing.
