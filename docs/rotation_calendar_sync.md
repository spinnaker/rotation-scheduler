## rotation calendar sync

Sync a schedule to a shared calendar.

### Synopsis

A dedicated user to own these events is **strongly** recommended. 
When a schedule of shifts is sync'ed, all events on that user's primary calendar 
are cleared and each shift is added. The service account must be authorized to do 
this to another users's calendar by granting it G Suite's "Domain-wide Delegation."

```
rotation calendar sync scheduleFilePath [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -c, --calendarID string   Optional. The calendar ID to update. Must be a 'primary' user calendar. (default "spinbot@spinnaker.io")
  -h, --help                help for sync
  -j, --jsonKey string      Required. A base64-encoded service account key with access to the Calendar API. Service account must have domain-wide delegation. Create this value with something like 'cat key.json | base64 -w 0'
```

### Options inherited from parent commands
